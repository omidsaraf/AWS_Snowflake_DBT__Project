# In a Banking Data Vault, you don't always want to run the whole pipeline. If a transaction file fails, you might only want to re-run the Staging and Links layers without touching the Customer Hub.

# Selectors allow you to create "shortcuts" for these complex runs.

# How to use it in your terminal
# Instead of typing long paths, you can now use the names you defined:

# To run only staging: dbt run --selector staging_layer

# To run the whole Vault: dbt run --selector raw_vault_layer

# Why this is important for your project
# As your banking platform grows, you might have 100+ tables. Running everything every time is expensive in Snowflake. Selectors give you surgical control over which part of the "Medallion" architecture you are updating.
